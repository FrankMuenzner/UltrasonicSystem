A small ultrasonic system which can be used by hobbyists for:

* Mixing
* Cell disruption
* Levitation
* Cavitation experiments
* Ultrasonic chemistry
* ...and other tasks

The system consists of a transducer, a tuned aluminum horn, an ATX supply for power, an SMPS transformer from a second power supply, a PCB power driver, and mounting hardware.

Not counting the two ATX power supplies, a complete system can be made for around $60USD, more or less, depending on how good you are at scavenging.
